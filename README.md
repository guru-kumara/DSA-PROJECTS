# DSA-PROJECTS
# 🚀 DSA-PROJECTS in Java

This repository contains a collection of **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** projects and mini-applications built using **Java**. These are designed to demonstrate fundamental and advanced DSA concepts through hands-on implementation, console interaction, and GUI visualizations.

## 📦 Project List

### 1. 🌳 [Tree Traversals (Inorder, Preorder, Postorder)](./DSA-TREE-TRAVERSAL)
- Implements DFS traversal techniques on a binary tree
- Concepts: Recursion, TreeNode class, Inorder / Preorder / Postorder
- Output printed in the console

### 2. 🧮 [Sorting Visualizer (Bubble Sort GUI)](./DSA-SORTING-VISUALIZER)
- GUI-based Bubble Sort visualizer using Java Swing
- Red bars indicate comparisons, Blue bars are unsorted
- Concepts: Array, Sorting, Thread.sleep, paintComponent()

### 3. 📏 [Shortest Path (Dijkstra’s Algorithm using TreeSet)](./DSA-GRAPH-DIJKSTRA)
- Undirected weighted graph with Dijkstra’s algorithm
- Implements TreeSet as a min-priority queue
- Console-based shortest path output from source node

### 4. 🥞 [Stack & Queue Visualizer (Java Swing)](./DSA-STACK-QUEUE-VISUALIZER)
- Real-time visualization of Stack and Queue operations
- Push / Pop / Enqueue / Dequeue via GUI buttons
- Concepts: Java Collections, Event-driven programming

### 5. 🎯 [Number Guessing Game](./DSA-GAME-NUMBER-GUESS)
- Classic number guessing game using random numbers
- Console-based user input and attempt counter
- Concepts: Loops, Conditionals, Random, Scanner

### 6. 🔤 [Word Dictionary using Trie](./DSA-TRIE-WORD-DICTIONARY)
- Adds and searches words using Trie data structure
- Supports wildcard character `.` during search
- Console interface with menu-driven interaction
