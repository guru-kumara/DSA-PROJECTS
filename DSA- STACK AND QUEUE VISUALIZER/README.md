# Stack and Queue Visualizer in Java 🥞🚶‍♂️

This is a Java Swing GUI application that visually demonstrates the behavior of two core data structures in DSA:

- **Stack** (LIFO – Last In First Out)
- **Queue** (FIFO – First In First Out)

It provides real-time visual updates for `push`, `pop`, `enqueue`, and `dequeue` operations using buttons.

---

## ✅ Features

- 🟦 Push random numbers to a **stack**
- 🔴 Pop elements from the stack
- 🟨 Enqueue random numbers to a **queue**
- 🟩 Dequeue elements from the queue
- 📄 Real-time updates displayed in a `JTextArea`
- 🧩 Simple and intuitive Swing GUI

---

## 🧠 Concepts Used

- Stack and Queue operations
- Java `Stack` and `Queue` collections
- GUI Programming with Java Swing (`JFrame`, `JButton`, `JTextArea`, `JScrollPane`)
- Event-driven programming (`ActionListener`)
