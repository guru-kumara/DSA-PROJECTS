# Tree Traversal in Java 🌳

This project demonstrates the three fundamental depth-first search (DFS) traversals of a binary tree using recursion in Java:

- **Inorder Traversal** (Left → Root → Right)
- **Preorder Traversal** (Root → Left → Right)
- **Postorder Traversal** (Left → Right → Root)

These are essential operations in binary tree algorithms and often appear in coding interviews and competitive programming.

---

## ✅ Features

- Implements a simple `TreeNode` class to build a binary tree.
- Defines all three traversal algorithms using recursive methods.
- Runs a demo tree in the `main` method and prints traversal orders.

## 🧪 Sample Output

Inorder: 4 2 5 1 3
Preorder: 1 2 4 5 3
Postorder: 4 5 2 3 1
