# Bubble Sort Visualizer in Java (Swing UI) 🧮🎨

This project is a **Java Swing GUI-based visualization** of the **Bubble Sort** algorithm. It visually shows the process of sorting an array with animated bar movements and color highlights for comparisons.

---

## 🎯 Features

- 🧠 Visualizes the **Bubble Sort** algorithm step-by-step
- 🟥 Highlights compared elements in **red**
- 🔵 Displays other elements in **blue**
- 🪄 Smooth animation using `Thread.sleep()` and `repaint()`
- 📦 Built using Java Swing (`JFrame`, `JPanel`, `Graphics`)

---

## 🖼️ What You See

Each value in the array is represented as a **vertical bar**, where:
- The **height** of the bar = array value
- The **color red** indicates the current elements being compared
