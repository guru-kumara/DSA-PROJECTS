# Word Dictionary using Trie in Java 📚🔠

This project implements a **Word Dictionary** using the **Trie data structure** in Java. It allows users to:

- Add words to the dictionary
- Search for words (with support for `.` wildcard characters)
- Interact with the application via console using `Scanner`

---

## ✅ Features

- 🔤 Add new words to the trie
- 🔍 Search words with exact match or use `.` as a **wildcard**
- 🧠 Built from scratch using OOP and Trie nodes
- 📟 Console-based interface using Java `Scanner`
- 🔁 Continuous user interaction (looped menu)

---

## 🧠 Concepts Used

- Trie Data Structure (Prefix Tree)
- Recursion for wildcard support
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Java Collections
- Console I/O (`Scanner`)
- Menu-based CLI navigation
